Overview
===========
This is a JavaScript for Automation binding (glue code) for using Pashua with JavaScript for Automation. Pashua is a macOS application for using native GUI dialog windows in various programming languages.

This code can be found in a GitHub repository at https://github.com/RobTrew/Pashua-Binding-JXA. For examples in other programming languages, see https://github.com/BlueM/Pashua-Bindings.

Usage
======
This repository contains uncompiled JavaScript for Automation code. You can open any of:
- Example1ConfigTextJS.applescript
- Example2ConfigObjectJS.applescript
- Example3MixedJS.applescript

and run them in Script Editor (NB choose JavaScript in the language selector at top left), but they need a compiled version of “PashuaJS.applescript” (which is also in this folder) to be copied to ~/Library/Script Libraries/ as PashuaJS.scpt

One solution: simply open a Terminal window, run “compileJS.sh” (i.e. cd to the folder containing these files, then drag the icon of `compileJS.sh` onto the Terminal window and hit Return) and you’re done. You should now have:
- “Example1ConfigTextJS.scpt”
- “Example2ConfigObjectJS.scpt”
- “Example3MixedJS.applescript”

in the same folder, and “PashuaJS.scpt” in ~/Library/Script Libraries/ as “~/Library/Script Libraries/PashuaJS.scpt”

The first three scripts are examples of using Pashua to define, display and read the results of a custom dialog , while “~/Library/Script Libraries/PashuaJS.scpt” is the “library” for handling the communication with Pashua.

You will, of course, need Pashua.app on your Mac to run the example. The code expects Pashua.app in one of the “typical” locations, such as the global or the user’s “Applications” folder.
